           <dt><h2>Ingredients</h2></dt>
           <ul>
            <li>Cashews (Kaju): 1 cup</li>
            <li>Sugar: 1/2 cup</li>
            <li>Water: 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>Cardamom Powder: 1/4 tsp</li>
            <li>Ghee (Clarified Butter): 1 tsp</li>
           </ul>

           <dt><h2>Instructions</h2></dt>
           <ol>
            <li>Grind the cashews to a fine powder using a dry grinder or food processor. Be careful not to grind too long, as it can turn into a paste.</li>
            <li>In a pan, mix sugar and water. Heat the mixture on medium flame until the sugar completely dissolves and forms a single-thread consistency syrup. This means the syrup should form a thin, unbroken thread when a small drop is pulled between two fingers.</li>
            <li>Add the cashew powder to the sugar syrup while continuously stirring to avoid lumps. Ensure the mixture is smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Continue to cook on low heat, stirring continuously. The mixture will start to thicken and leave the sides of the pan. This should take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cardamom powder and ghee to the mixture. Mix well until the ghee is incorporated.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a greased plate or a piece of parchment paper. Allow it to cool slightly until it is safe to handle.</li>
            <li>Knead the mixture lightly to ensure it is smooth and free from lumps.</li>
            <li>Roll out the mixture using a greased rolling pin to about 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Let it cool completely. Once cooled, cut the rolled-out mixture into diamond-shaped pieces using a sharp knife.
            </li>
            <li>Kaju Katli is ready to be served. It can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.</li>
