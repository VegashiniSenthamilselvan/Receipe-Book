           <dd>Beef Stew is a classic dish found in many cultures worldwide, each with its own variations. The basic premise involves simmering beef with vegetables in a flavorful broth until everything is tender and well-blended. Commonly used ingredients include root vegetables like carrots and potatoes, as well as aromatic herbs and spices.</dd>

           <li> Onion: 1 large, chopped</li>
           <li> Garlic: 3 cloves, minced</li>
           <li>Carrots: 3, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
           <li>Celery: 3 stalks, chopped</li>
           <li>Potatoes: 3 large, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
           <li> Tomato paste: 2 tbsp</li>
           <li> Beef broth: 4 cups</li>
           <li> Bay leaves: 2</li>
           <li> Thyme: 1 tsp dried (or 1 tbsp fresh)</li>
           <li> Rosemary: 1 tsp dried (or 1 tbsp fresh)</li>
           <li>  Worcestershire sauce: 1 tbsp</li>
           <li>  Frozen peas: 1 cup (optional)</li>
           <li> Fresh parsley: chopped, for garnish</li>
           </ul>

           <dt><h2>Instructions</h2></dt>
           <ol>
            <li>Season the beef cubes with salt and pepper. Dredge them in flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Brown the beef on all sides, then remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, add a bit more olive oil if needed. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.

            </li>
            <li>Add the carrots, celery, and potatoes to the pot. Stir to combine with the onions and garlic.

            </li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2-3 minutes, allowing it to coat the vegetables and develop its flavor.
            </li>
            <li>Pour in the beef broth and red wine (if using), scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Return the browned beef to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to combine. Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 2 to 2.5 hours, or until the beef and vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>If using frozen peas, add them to the stew in the last 10 minutes of cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.</li>
