           <dd>Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Italian pasta dish that originates from the Lazio region, particularly Rome. It's renowned for its simplicity, rich flavor, and creamy texture, despite being made without any cream. The dish is a testament to the beauty of using just a few high-quality ingredients to create a delectable meal.</dd>
           <dt><h2>Ingredients</h2></dt>
           <ul>
           <li>Spaghetti: 200g</li>
           <li>Pancetta (or bacon): 100g, finely chopped</li>
           <li>Large eggs: 2</li> 
           <li>Pecorino cheese: 50g, grated</li>
           <li>Parmesan cheese: 50g, grated</li>
           <li>Garlic: 1 clove, peeled and crushed</li>
           <li>Black pepper: freshly ground</li>
           <li>Salt: to taste</li>
           <li>Olive oil: 1 tbsp (optional, for cooking pancetta)</li>
           </ul>

           <dt><h2>Instructions</h2></dt>
           <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water before draining the pasta.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, beat the eggs in a bowl and add the grated Pecorino and Parmesan cheeses. Mix well and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the olive oil (if using) over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until it becomes crispy and golden. Add the crushed garlic and saut√© for another minute, then remove the garlic from the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add the drained spaghetti to the pan with the pancetta. Toss well to coat the pasta with the pancetta fat.
            </li>
            <li>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Add some of the reserved pasta water a little at a time to achieve a creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>Season with freshly ground black pepper and a little salt if needed. Serve immediately with extra grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
