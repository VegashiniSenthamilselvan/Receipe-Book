           <dd>Chocolate cake is a popular dessert made from a batter that includes flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and other ingredients that come together to create a moist, rich, and flavorful cake. The chocolate flavor can be intensified by using high-quality cocoa powder or melted chocolate in the batter. Chocolate cake is often layered and frosted with chocolate or other flavored frostings to enhance its taste and presentation.</dd>

           <dt><h2>Instructions</h2></dt>
           <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans or line them with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes until smooth.

            </li>
            <li>Stir in the boiling water until the batter is well combined. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
                Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, cream the softened butter until smooth.
                Gradually add the cocoa powder and powdered sugar, alternating with the milk, beating on low speed until smooth and creamy.
                Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand.
                Spread a generous amount of frosting over the top.
                Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake.</li>
                <li>Decorate with sprinkles, chocolate shavings, or other toppings if desired.
                    Slice and enjoy!</li>
